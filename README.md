# Curriculum Vitae [![Continuous deployment](https://github.com/thomaseizinger/curriculum-vitae/actions/workflows/CD.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/thomaseizinger/curriculum-vitae/actions/workflows/CD.yml)

This repo contains the source code for my CV.

It uses GitHub actions to automatically re-create the PDF from the source code upon every commit in the master branch.
The resulting PDF is pushed to a gh-pages branch.

The link on my [website](https://eizinger.io) directly links to this gh-pages branch so it always references the newest version of the CV.
