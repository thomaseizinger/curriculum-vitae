# Curriculum Vitae [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thomaseizinger/curriculum-vitae.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thomaseizinger/curriculum-vitae)

This repo contains the source code for my CV.

It uses Travis CI, Docker and Tectonic to automatically re-create the PDF from the source code upon every commit in the master branch. The resulting PDF is pushed to a gh-pages branch.

The document class is based on https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv.

The link on my [website](http://eizinger.io) directly links to this gh-pages branch so it always references the newest version of the CV.
