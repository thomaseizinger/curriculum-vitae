# Curriculum Vitae

This repo contains the source code for my CV.

It uses Travis CI, Docker and Tectonic to automatically re-create the PDF from the source code upon every commit in the master branch. The resulting PDF is pushed to a gh-pages branch.

The link on my website (http://eizinger.io) directly links to this gh-pages branch so it always referenced the newest version of the CV.
